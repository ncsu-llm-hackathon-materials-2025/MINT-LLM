# MINT_LLM
Molecular INsight Toolkit (MINT LLM) is a lightweight, AI-assisted platform for analyzing molecular dynamics trajectories. It integrates MDAnalysis with a natural language interface to automatically compute observables such as RDF and RMSD and generate plots.. Designed for soft-matter simulations, it makes trajectory analysis fast and reproducible.
